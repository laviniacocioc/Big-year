In this exercise I designed and implemented a database for bird-watchers. The database contains birds, each of which has a name (string) and a name in Latin
(string). The database also counts the observations of each bird.

The program must implement the following commands:

Add - adds a bird
Observation - adds an observation
All - prints all birds
One - prints one bird
Quit - ends the program
Incorrect input must also be handled. The following is an example of the program functionality:

Sample output
? Add
Name: Crow
Name in Latin: Corvus Corvus
? Add
Name: Hawk
Name in Latin: Dorkus Dorkus
? Observation
Bird? Hawk
? Observation
Bird? Lion
Not a bird!
? Observation
Bird? Hawk
? All
Hawk (Dorkus Dorkus): 2 observations
Crow (Corvus Corvus): 0 observations
? One
Bird? Hawk
Hawk (Dorkus Dorkus): 2 observations
? Quit
